# ChekMate - Dating Experience Platform

**"Dating can be a Game - Don't Get Played"**

ChekMate is the **first-in-class social platform** dedicated to sharing and rating dating experiences. Share your date stories, rate your experiences with WOW/GTFOH/ChekMate, and discover what others are saying about their dating adventures.
