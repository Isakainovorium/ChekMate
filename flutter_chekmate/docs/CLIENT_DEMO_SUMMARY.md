## 🎯 **Distribution Strategy**

### **Android (✅ READY NOW)**
**Method:** GitHub Release  
**Cost:** FREE  
**User Experience:** Good (3-tap installation)  
**Recommended:** ✅ YES - Perfect for client demo  

**How Client Installs:**
1. Open GitHub Release link on Android device
2. Download app-release.apk
3. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"

### **iOS (⏳ AFTER FUNDING APPROVAL)**
**Method:** TestFlight (NOT GitHub Release)  
**Cost:** $99/year (Apple Developer account)  
**User Experience:** Excellent (1-tap installation)  
**Recommended:** ✅ YES - Industry standard  

**Why NOT GitHub Release for iOS:**
- ❌ Requires pre-registering device UDIDs (complex)

- ❌ Requires rebuilding for each new device
- ❌ Poor user experience (PLIST files, special URLs)
- ❌ Unprofessional for client demos

**Why TestFlight:**
- ✅ Simple 1-tap installation
