# ChekMate Web PWA - Implementation Status

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Branch:** `web-pwa`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **Phase 1 Complete - Web Build Successful**  

---

## üéØ **Project Overview**

**Goal:** Build a Flutter Web PWA version of ChekMate for client testing when Android device is not available.

**Reason:** Client does not have an Android device, so web version is the only way to test the app before funding approval.

**Understanding:** We acknowledge the limitations (camera, audio, iOS notifications) but are maximizing what IS possible on web.
