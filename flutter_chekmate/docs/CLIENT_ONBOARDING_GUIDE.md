**After installation:**
- You can disable "Unknown Sources" again for security

**Solution:** 
- Make sure you have enough storage space (100 MB)

- Restart your device and try again

**Problem:** Can't find the downloaded APK  
**Solution:**
- Check your **Downloads** folder
- Check your browser's download history
