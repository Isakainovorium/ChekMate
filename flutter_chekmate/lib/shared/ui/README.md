# shared/ui

A central place for reusable UI primitives that match the Figma design.

- Uses app tokens from `lib/core/theme/`.
- Keep variants and sizes consistent across the app.
- Add each component to Widgetbook for rapid visual review.

- AppButton
- AppCard
- AppDialog

Planned next primitives: Sheet (modal bottom sheet), Popover, Tooltip, Dropdown/Select, Tabs, Menus, Skeleton, Progress, Table, Pagination, Avatar, Carousel.
